Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) stands at the forefront of innovation in Generative AI, offering exciting possibilities for natural language processing and interaction. In this blog, we delve into the integration of RAG with CSV files, harnessing its potential to revolutionize conversational AI.

## Introduction:
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) represents a transformative approach to AI-driven conversations, combining the strengths of retrieval-based systems with generative models. At its core, RAG seamlessly retrieves and synthesizes information from various sources, including CSV files, to generate contextually relevant responses. Let’s explore the architecture and functionality of RAG, focusing particularly on its interaction with CSV data.
The basic architecture for RAG is as below:

## RAG’s architecture encompasses several key components:
Input Processing: RAG accepts diverse file formats such as PDFs, Excel sheets, and CSV files as input. Large files are segmented into manageable chunks for efficient processing.
Embedding and Indexing: Each chunk undergoes embedding using models like sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2, followed by indexing within databases such as vectorDB, FAISS, or Pinecone. This step facilitates rapid retrieval and comparison of information.
User Interaction: User queries trigger the embedding process for their input, which is then compared against indexed chunks to determine similarity scores.
Response Generation: Chunks with the highest similarity scores are fed into Language Model (LLM) frameworks like LLAMA-2, GPT-3, or GEMINI-PRO. The LLM generates contextually appropriate responses based on the retrieved content.
